    "bedrock_analysis": "1. Kitchen Layout Assessment:\nThe detected refrigerator and oven indicate this is likely a galley or corridor style kitchen layout. The appliances seem well positioned, though a sink was not detected which is an essential missing element.\n\n2. Renovation Recommendations:\n- Maintain the current appliance locations as the layout is functional\n- Add a new sink and faucet near the oven for a work triangle flow\n- Upgrade cabinets to maximize storage, consider floor to ceiling cabinetry\n- Open shelving can provide display storage and make the space feel larger\n\n3. Material Suggestions:\n- Granite or quartz countertops add durability and elevate the look\n- Solid wood cabinets have a high-end look, consider a two-tone color scheme \n- Subway tile backsplash is a classic, on-trend choice\n- Luxury vinyl plank (LVP) flooring is water-resistant and looks like wood\n\n4. Cost Considerations for Australian Market:\n- Cabinet refacing starts around $5,000 AUD, full cabinet replacement $15,000+\n- Granite countertops $100-200 per square foot installed \n- Appliance costs vary, $2,000+ for fridge, $1,000+ for oven\n- Professional installation fees for plumbing, electrical, etc.\n- Overall expect $20,000 - $40,000 AUD for a mid-range renovation\n\nLet me know if you need any other details! Proper planning for layout, materials and budget will ensure a beautiful, functional new kitchen.",
