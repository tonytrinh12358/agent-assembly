Object Detection & Material Analysis\n\nBased on the image analysis, I've detected the following elements in your kitchen:\n\n**Detected Objects:**\n- Countertop (95% confidence)\n- Floor (95% confidence)\n- Wall (95% confidence)\n- Ceiling (95% confidence)\n- Shelf (54% confidence)\n\n**Materials Identified:**\n- Granite countertops (45.61 sq m)\n- Wood cabinets (14.00 sq m)\n- Tile flooring (18.50 sq m)\n\n**Kitchen Measurements:**\n- Total kitchen area: 341.31 sq m\n- Countertop area: 7.50 sq m\n- Cabinet area: 14.00 sq m\n- Flooring area: 18.50 sq m\n- No appliances were detected in the image\n\n## 2. Detailed Cost Estimation\n\nBased on your request for a standard quality grade renovation including labor costs, here's a comprehensive cost breakdown:\n\n### Material Costs (AUD):\n- **Granite Countertops:** $15,963.50 - $22,805.00 (Average: $19,384.25)\n- **Wood Cabinets:** $3,920.00 - $5,600.00 (Average: $4,760.00)\n- **Tile Flooring:** $1,202.50 - $2,220.00 (Average: $1,711.25)\n- **Total Materials:** $21,086.00 - $30,625.00 (Average: $25,855.50)\n\n### Labor Costs (AUD):\n- **Cabinet Installation:** $1,120.00 - $1,680.00 (Average: $1,400.00)\n- **Granite Installation:** $4,561.00 - $6,841.50 (Average: $5,701.25)\n- **Flooring Installation:** $1,110.00 - $1,665.00 (Average: $1,387.50)\n- **Appliance Installation:** $1,000.00 - $1,500.00 (Average: $1,250.00)\n- **Total Labor:** $7,791.00 - $11,686.50 (Average: $9,738.75)\n\n### Overall Project Costs:\n- **Base Subtotal:** $35,594.25 (Materials + Labor)\n- **Contingency (15%):** $5,339.14\n- **Project Total:** $40,933.39\n- **Cost per sq m:** $524.05\n- **Budget Range:** $34,793.38 - $47,073.40\n\n## 3. Personalized Renovation Recommendations\n\nBased on our analysis of your kitchen and cost estimates, I recommend the following:\n\n1. **Consider Quartz Alternatives:** While granite countertops are detected, the large area (45.61 sq m) contributes significantly to your budget. Switching to quality quartz options could provide similar aesthetics with potential savings of $3,000-$5,000.\n\n2. **Optimize Cabinet Space:** The limited cabinet area (14 sq m) suggests potential for expanding storage. Consider adding wall-mounted cabinets or a kitchen island with additional storage to improve functionality.\n\n3. **Workflow Improvement:** The detected shelf and single countertop suggest a non-optimal workflow. Implementing a classic work triangle (sink-stove-refrigerator) would enhance functionality and efficiency.\n\n4. **Flooring Upgrade:** The existing tile flooring (18.5 sq m) could be upgraded to more durable porcelain or luxury vinyl planks within the standard quality grade, offering better longevity and maintenance benefits.\n\n5. **Appliance Integration:** No appliances were detected in the analysis. Allocate approximately $5,000-$8,000 (beyond the estimated renovation costs) for standard-grade appliances including refrigerator, stove, dishwasher, and range hood.\n\n6. **Lighting Enhancements:** Consider adding under-cabinet lighting, pendant lights over potential island areas, and recessed ceiling lights to improve functionality and ambiance.\n\n7. **Splashback Addition:** Adding a tile or glass splashback would protect walls and enhance visual appeal (budget approximately $1,200-$2,000 for standard quality options).\n\n## 4. Summary & Budget Guidance\n\nYour kitchen renovation at standard quality grade will cost approximately **$40,933** including materials, labor, and a 15% contingency. This represents a mid-range renovation with good value for your investment.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n- The large granite countertop area is driving up costs significantly\n- Wood cabinetry offers good value but could be expanded for better functionality\n- The existing layout appears basic and would benefit from workflow optimization\n- Your budget allows for some premium upgrades in select areas\n\n**Budget Guidance:**\n- If you need to reduce costs, consider alternative countertop materials (-$3,000 to -$5,000)\n- Phasing the renovation could help manage upfront costs\n- Your standard quality grade selection offers good balance of cost vs. durability\n- Add approximately $5,000-$8,000 for new appliances (not included in estimate)\n- Allow for potential additional costs for plumbing or electrical modifications\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Consult with a kitchen designer to optimize layout\n2. Get quotes from 2-3 contractors to compare with these estimates\n3. Finalize material selections with samples before committing\n4. Check local council requirements for any permits needed\n\nCOST_DATA_JSON: {\"total_cost\": 40933.39, \"material_cost\": 25855.5, \"labor_cost\": 9738.75}"
